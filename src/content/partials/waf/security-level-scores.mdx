## Security levels

Security levels are based on the threat score (except _Off_ and _I'm Under Attack!_). You can adjust the security level to challenge incoming requests based on the threat they pose.

The available security levels are the following:

| Security Level                      | Threat score range | Description                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Off (Enterprise<br/>customers only) | _N/A_              | Does not challenge IP addresses.                                                     |
| Essentially off                     | 50–100             | Only challenges IP addresses with the worst reputation.                              |
| Low                                 | 25–100             | Challenges only threatening visitors.                                                |
| Medium                              | 15–100             | Challenges both threatening and moderately threatening visitors.                     |
| High                                | 0–100              | Challenges all visitors that exhibited threatening behavior within the last 14 days. |
| I'm Under Attack!                   | _N/A_              | Only for use if your website is currently under a DDoS attack.                       |

Selecting a higher **Security Level** value means that even requests with a lower risk (that is, with a low [threat score](#threat-score)) will be challenged. Selecting a lower **Security Level** value means that only requests posing a higher risk (that is, with a high threat score) will be challenged.

Security levels from _Essentially off_ to _High_ will challenge the visitor using a Managed Challenge. When you select _I'm Under Attack!_, which enables [I'm Under Attack mode](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/), Cloudflare will present a JS challenge page.

:::caution

Only use [I'm Under Attack mode](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/) when a website is under a DDoS attack. I'm Under Attack mode may affect some actions on your domain, such as your API traffic.

To set a custom security level for your API or any other part of your domain, create a [configuration rule](/rules/configuration-rules/).
